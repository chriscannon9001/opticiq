Introduction
============
opticiq is currently a very rough prototype without most of the needed functionality working.

The goal is to bring optical engineering experts together to collaborate and codify image quality testing, beam quality testing, and some other related useful metrics, into an open source resource. And by doing so, to elevate the field, and minimize wasted redundant code.

Aspiring Features
-----------------
* IQ test chart generation, for display, printing, or lithography
* Various MTF test methods, using point, line, or edge function tests
* Grid and distortion testing
* Beam diameter (or star diameter), and other beam metrics
* Low-level functions that support the above features, e.g. auto-ROI

Status

early prototype

Some ideas have been represented. Most of the functionality is not setup.
