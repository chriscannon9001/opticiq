Introduction
============
opticiq should one day become a collection of general purpose tools for optical testing.

The goal is to bring experts together to collaborate and codify image quality testing, beam quality testing, and some related metrics, into an open source lib. And by doing so, to elevate the field, and minimize wasted redundant code.

Aspiring Feature Set
--------------------
* IQ test chart generation, for display, print, or lithography (partially complete)
* Various MTF test methods, using point, line, or edge function tests
* Grid and distortion testing
* Beam diameter (or star diameter), and other beam metrics
* Low-level functions that support the above features, e.g. gradient tests and auto-ROI (partially complete)

Reusability Goals
-----------------

A key aim for opticiq is quality and reuse. To illustrate, here are some goals:

    * Library functions emphasizing generalization before automation
    * Docstrings
    * Documentation
    * Examples

early prototype

Some ideas have been represented. Most of the functionality is not setup.
